	description = Centaurs are icy bodies that have been pulled into the outer solar system by the gravity of Neptune and the other giant planets. Some of them show cometary activity and many may eventually become short- or intermediate-period comets, but for now they orbit beyond Jupiter.

	description = Sungrazing comets pass extremely close to the Sun during perihelion, and might even touch the edge of its atmosphere. However, these are extremely hard to find, so be on the lookout for them!
