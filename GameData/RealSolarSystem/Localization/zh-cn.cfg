        He told the second he would have a motorcycle because he only cheated on his wife once and he regretted it.
        
        Then he told the third guy he would have a bicycle because he cheated on his wife alot.
        
        Well, two years later, the man on the bicycle spotted the man in the Cadillac crying.

A ship sails on the ocean. The ocean is made of water. Fish live in water. The Chinese are noted for eating a lot of fish. The Chinese are called red. So therefore, a fire engine is red.

Now if only you could find your false teeth you could tell mission control about how in your day, pilots had to navigate manually. At that point the young men and women at mission control will sigh, and you will tell them that they should respect you.
        #RSS_Science_EVAReport_KerberosSrfLanded = Kerberos? Kerb-eros. Strange. There was a video game you played in your youth with a suspiciously similar name.
        #RSS_Science_EVAReport_ChuryumovGerasimenkoInSpaceLow = You could probably use a quick few puffs of your jetpack to land.
        #RSS_Science_EVAReport_ChuryumovGerasimenkoInSpaceHigh = The comet is strange and unevenly shaped. It reminds you of a rubber ducky. How long has it been since you had a bath?
        #RSS_Science_EVAReport_ChuryumovGerasimenkoSrfLanded1 = Hey! You found Philae!
        #RSS_Science_EVAReport_ChuryumovGerasimenkoSrfLanded2 = Is it just you or does the ground seem to be boiling away?

        //Surface Sample
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MoonSrfLanded1 = As you pick up another cool rock, you decide to turn your sample collector into a golfing iron and hit a few rocks.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MoonSrfLanded2 = The samples are remarkably similar to Earth rocks.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_VenusSrfLanded = The grey-orange rocks are very rounded due to wind erosion. The surface is cracked.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLanded1 = The grey rocks dot the surface, and the soil is rich in iron. Just below the red soil is a dark grey surface.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLanded2 = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine sand-like dust, and it appears to be getting everywhere.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLanded3 = You hum the tune to Gustav Holst's Mars soundtrack as you pick up another rock.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLanded4 = Unable to satisfy your Curiosity, you attempt to drill into the rock with your tool. You're thinking it would be a lot easier if you had some kind of pulsating drill thing on a robotic arm.

        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLandedNorthIceCap1 = The ground is frozen carbon dioxide. Just under the dry ice is a layer of red dust and then grey rock. There's some water ice scatterered around as well.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLandedSouthIceCap1 = The ground is frozen carbon dioxide and reddish dirt. You wonder what Mars would be like if it had much larger ice caps.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLandedNorthIceCap2 = Snow Angel-nauts would seem to be possible here. This warrants further testing.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLandedSouthIceCap2 = Snowball wars could be fought out here.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_MarsSrfLandedOlympusMons = Beneath the red dust is several layers of frozen lava!
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_IoSrfLanded1 = There is plenty of sulphur and sulphur dioxide frosts along the surface. Any rocks or terrain features are likely very very young due to the rapidity in which Io reshapes its surface.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_IoSrfLanded2 = You are upset that your hypothesis about Io being a three-dimensional slice of a four-dimensional hyperpizza is being proven inaccurate.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_EuropaSrfLanded1 = The surface consists of ice, dirt, and more ice.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_EuropaSrfLanded2 = Oh if only you had a way of drilling deeper into the ice to sample the underground ocean!

        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_PlutoSrfLanded = You barely remember why you left the ship. Something to do with surface samples? Oh yes, that's it. You fiddle around for the sample collector and find all sorts of non-water ices. 
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_HyperionSrfLanded = The dust practically flies off to escape velocity when you try to grab some of it. The planet seems to be held together more magically than gravitationally. 
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_TitanSrfLanded = The rocks? Solid ice. The dirt? Snow. It's all totally frozen. Virtually indistinguishable in appearance from rock and dirt. 
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_TitanSrfSplashed = While normally the appearance of organic molecules in a lake on another world would be huge news, unfortunately the organic molecule in question is liquid methane, which happens to be the liquid that the lake is made from. Any study of this sample would have to be done in a heavily refrigerated container.
        #RSS_Science_SurfaceSample_ChuryumovGerasimenkoSrfLanded = The ices and organic molecules in the sample could provide a fascinating look into the possible origins of the solar system and life on Earth.

        #RSS_Science_TempScan_VenusFlyingHigh = The temperature is only a little warmer than Earth sea level here. In fact if it weren't for the poisonous acid in the atmosphere and the lack of oxygen, this might be one of the most Earthlike places in the solar system (other than Earth, of course.)
        #RSS_Science_TempScan_MarsSrfLanded = Depending on the orientation, the thermometer either reads cold or very cold.
        #RSS_Science_TempScan_IoSrfLanded = It's quite warm here on account of the tidal heating.
        #RSS_Science_TempScan_EuropaSrfLanded = While the surface is pitifully cold, in the tidally heated interior of the planet the water may very well be liquid.
        #RSS_Science_TempScan_TitanSrfLanded = The thermometer has frozen. This is one of the coldest places in the solar system.
        #RSS_Science_TempScan_UranusFlyingLow = Uranus has the absolute coldest atmosphere in the entire solar system, at just over 42 kelvins. Let's hope the spacecraft has a good heater.

        #RSS_Science_SeismicScan_EnceladusSrfLanded = This moon is cryovolcanic and is spewing its insides into space.
        #RSS_Science_SeismicScan_MoonSrfLanded = A few minor moonquakes every once in a while. All due to impacts, as the Moon is geologically dead.
        #RSS_Science_SeismicScan_CeresSrfLanded = The dwarf planet is mildly cryovolcanic.

        //Gravity Scan
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_EarthInSpace = The sensor has provided a more detailed map of Earth's local gravitational field.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_MoonInSpace = The sensor maps the extremely uneven gravitational field of the Moon.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_VenusInSpace = The sensor provides a map of the surface despite the extremely thick clouds blocking the surface from view.

        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_EuropaInSpace = Scanning from orbit hints at the internal makeup of Europa.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_PlutoSrfLanded = There is an extreme tidal effect from Charon skewing the results.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_CharonInSpace = Minute changes in Charon's orbit from the other Plutinan moons are being observed.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_NixInSpace = Nix seems to be rotating erratically due to influence from Pluto and Charon.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_HyraInSpace = Hydra's rotation is unpredictable due the tidal interactions of its parent dwarf planets Pluto and Charon.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_KerberosInSpace = Kerberos is rotating unpredictably thanks to interactions from the other moons of Pluto.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_StyxInSpace = It's hard to tell what direction Styx will be facing at any given time. This is likely due to gravitational interaction with Pluto and Charon.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_Hyperion = This thing is more like a collection of rocks held together with dust than it is a solid rock.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_IapetusInSpace = Iapetus' equatorial ridge provides a slight pull on the sensor. The orbit of a planet like Iapetus would likely precess over time.
        #RSS_Science_GravityScan_MercuryInSpace = The sensor has difficulty mapping the surface of Mercury due to the tidal influence from the Sun.

        //Atmosphere Analysis
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_VenusSrfLanded = Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, and Sulphuric Acid. Not fun stuff to breathe, certainly not at these temperatures.

        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_EarthFlyingHigh = It seems there is very little atmosphere at these altitudes. Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_EarthSrfLanded = Temperature and Pressure readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_EarthSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the Deserts. The sensors were getting clogged up with dust. 		
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_EarthSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere was found to be very, very cold indeed. Some sensors froze shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air. 		
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_DunaSrfLanded = The thin Carbon Dioxide atmosphere is full of dust particles. Not breathable. Almost, but not quite, a vacuum.
        #RSS_Science_AtmoAnalysis_JupiterFlyingHigh = The clouds are made from Ammonia ice, 

        //Mystery Goo

"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that" was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.		
        #RSS_Science_MML_JupiterFlyingHigh = The intense crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.		
        #RSS_Science_MML_JupiterFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.

        #RSS_Science_MML_PlutoSrfLanded1 = You lost your glasses, and without them you can't see the computer report. Mission control remarks that the small text is a terrible feature of decades-old computers.
        #RSS_Science_MML_PlutoSrfLanded2 = Although not much happens to the samples, your bio monitor seems to be flatlining for a few seconds. Are you finally dying? After all this time? You see you accidentally unplugged the bio monitor. Pluto won't grab you into the underworld yet!
        #RSS_Science_MML_CharonSrfLanded = Some of the black-colored chalks escape from the container, and falls on the ground. Aside from this incident, the materials are very unreactive.
